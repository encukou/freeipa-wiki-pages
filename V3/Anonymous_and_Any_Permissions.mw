__NOTOC__

= Overview =

Allow IPA permissions to apply to Anonymous and All authenticated users.

= Use Cases =

Note:
This is not very practical for write,
but until the global read ACI is removed,
examples need to use write permissions to be effective.

* Allow all authenticated users to edit other users' login shell

 ipa permission-add 'Shell editable by all' --type=user --attrs=loginshell --bindtype=all --permissions=write

* Allow all users (even anonymous ones via LDAP) to edit other users' login shell

 ipa permission-add 'Shell editable by anonymous' --type=user --attrs=loginshell --bindtype=anonymous --permissions=write

= Design= 

The <tt>permission_{add,mod,find}</tt> commands will get a new <tt>--bindtype</tt>
option (attribute name: <tt>ipapermbindruletype</tt>) with these values:

* "permission" (default) - Permission behaves as before -- grants access through privileges+roles
* "all" - Permission applies to all authenticated users (<tt>ldap:///all</tt>)
* "anonymous" - Permission applies to all users, even unauthenticated ones (<tt>ldap:///anyone</tt>)

Note:
As IPA API always requires authentication,
unauthenticated users would need to use LDAP directly.

The <tt>permission_{add,mod,find,show}</tt> commands will output
the <tt>ipapermbindruletype</tt>.

Permissions with <tt>ipapermbindruletype</tt> other than "permission"
may not be added to privileges,
and <tt>ipapermbindruletype</tt> other than "permission" may not be set on permissions
that are already members of a privilege.
(This will not be enforced on older servers.
Adding such a permission to a privilege will not have any effect.)

= Implementation =

No additional requirements or changes discovered during the implementation phase.

= Feature Management =

=== UI ===

The UI will need a new field for the bind type.

Adding permissions with non-default <tt>bindtype</tt> set to privileges,
and setting non-default <tt>bindtype</tt> on permissions in privileges,
should be disabled in the UI.

=== CLI ===

See Design.

= Major configuration options and enablement =

N/A

= Replication =

ACIs are replicated.

= Updates and Upgrades =

Permissions with non-default <tt>bindtype</tt> can only be created
on new servers, so thety will be [[V3/Permissions_V2|V2 permissions]].
This means old servers will not read or modify their ACIs.

Old servers will be able to add all permissions to privileges,
but privilege membership will not have any effect unless bindtype=permission.
Removing any permission from privileges will be possible on any server.

= Dependencies =

None

= External Impact =

Will need tests and documentation

= Backup and Restore =

ACIs are part of the DIT and so they are backed up.
