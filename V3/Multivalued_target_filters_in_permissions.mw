{{Admon/important|Work in progress|This design is not complete yet.
  However if you have any comments, please feel free to discuss.}}

= Overview =

Ticket [https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/4074 #4074]; also see the
[http://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-devel/2013-December/msg00063.html -devel thread]

The permission target filter will become multi-valued.

"Type" permissions, (such as most default permissions),
will use objectclass target filters instead of wildcard targets.

This is a change to [[V3/Permissions_V2|Permissions_V2]]
that will be implemented in the same release.

= Use Cases =

TODO

= Design=

== Multi-valued ipapermtargetfilter ==

The <tt>ipapermtargetfilter</tt> attribute,
and the corresponding <tt>filter</tt> option,
will become multi-valued.
When more than one value is present, they all need to apply --
they will be joined by <tt>(& )</tt> to create the ACI.

== Multivalued --memberof ==

Currently the <tt>--memberof</tt> option of <tt>permission-mod</tt> sets the
targetfilter to <tt>(memberof=<i>groupname</i>)</tt>.

The option will become multi-valued, and it will no longer conflict
with the <tt>--filter</tt> option.

When <tt>--memberof</tt> is specified,
the <tt>permission-mod</tt> command will remove any
existing <tt>(memberof=...)</tt> filter(s), but leave any other filters;
then add any additional filter(s) specified
by the <tt>--memberof</tt>, <tt>--type</tt>, <tt>--filter</tt> options.

The <tt>permission-add</tt> and <tt>permission-find</tt> commands will only
add the memberof filter to any filter(s)
specified by other options.

On output, memberof filter(s) matching existing group name(s) will
cause corresponding memberof output items.

== --type sets (objectclass=...) targetfilter ==

Currently the <tt>--type</tt> option sets the ACI location
to the appropriate container DN, and the
target to a wildcard DN: <tt><i>uid_attr</i>=*,<i>container_dn</i></tt>.

Instead of setting the target,
the option will now set the target filter to <tt>(objectclass=...)</tt>
(or possibly, multiple such filters).

Similarly to <tt>--memberof</tt>, <tt>permission-mod</tt>'s <tt>--type</tt>
will remove any existing <tt>(objectclass=...)</tt> filter(s).

On output, if the ACI location matches an eligible object type,
and proper objectclass filters are present,
a corresponding type will be reported.

=== Canonical objectclasses for filter ===

Each IPA object type that can be used for the <tt>--type</tt> option
will be assigned an object class that will be used for the filter.
These will initially be:

; user
: posixaccount
; group
: ipausergroup
; host
: ipahost
; service
: ipaservice
; hostgroup
: ipahostgroup
; netgroup
: ipanisnetgroup
; dnsrecord
: idnsrecord

These will be declared in their respective plugin classes.
The existence of this declaration will make the type usable
in a permission (in contrast with the current situation,
where a list of types is hardcoded in the permission & ACI plugins).

= Implementation =

No additional requirements or changes discovered during the implementation phase.

= Feature Management =

=== UI ===

The necessary UI design and changes
should be done as part of [[V3/Permissions V2]].

=== CLI ===

Permission <tt>--memberof</tt> and <tt>--filter</tt> options
will now accept multiple values.

= Updates and Upgrades =

This change will be implemented in the same release as [[V3/Permissions V2]].
See that design for update concerns.
